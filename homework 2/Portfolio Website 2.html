    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p> My Name is Austin Rohn. I am a traveling mechanical/Electrical Engineer. I got my education while traveling abroad to Germany for 3 years from the age of 21-23. I have
        been wanting a change of scenery from hotel rooms and planes so I decided to find a new passion. This is when I landed on Wedsite devolopment and front and back end devolpment.
        Tech has always been an interest of mine and I have always loved to tinker and mess around with things. I dont think I am going to stop here. i plan  on learning how to do anything from design
        video games, to software deveolpment for products. This will be updated with products when I get there.
    <br>
    <br>
        As for my personal life I love to travel and do anything that can give me an amazing adventours story. I am a certified Scuba diver, love to Snowboard, ride dirtbikes, hike through
        the mountians, rock climb. really anything that can get my blood flowing. Just like in my work I love pushing myself to my limits and then past in real life as well. To me if im not striving to do more then im not living.
         I live by the matto "try anything once and dont let fear stop you". As Brain Tracy once said "The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear". Family and friends are everything to me. 
        I plan on having a family someday but at the moment am focusing on me and my carrer.

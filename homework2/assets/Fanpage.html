    <h2>Bio:</h2>

    <p>
    Nathan John Feuerstein was born March 30, 1991, in Gladwin Michigan. he was a child of divorce and unfortunatly abuse by the hand of his Mothers boyfriend.
    At this time his father raised for the remainder of his teen year. is mother died of an overdose on 2009 (which inspired his song "how could you leave us"). he graduated 
    from Gladwin High School in 2009 as a varsity player for his basketball team. NF got his day view and started his career by performing at the fine arts festival which 
    was organized be connection church form my home town Canton Michigan. Like many other artists Nate started of young useing his talents as release from the stress and pain from his childhood which
    can be felt in his music. This Personally is what makes him so great to me. He would record his early works on a karoke machine, and play the instruments over it. he then relase his first ALbum  
    named Moments in 2010 under his own name independently. This Attracted Xist Music which then signed him and helped him grow. SInce then NF has grown tremendiously while still being in 
    charge of not only writing all of his music and performing it but also producing all beats and filming all video for the songs. I suspect this is only the beginning for such a talented artist.
